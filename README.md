# Contributions:
# Divya: 
1. Built the network stoichiometric array, made changes & tweaks to the network in order to balance the N array in the expa algorithm and optimize urea production
2. Computed reaction frequency array
3. Coded the reaction connectivity array
4. Studied for correlation between reaction frequency & connectivity

# Owais:
1. Studied literature work on stoichiometric arrays, helped build the stoichiometric array for this network
2. Coded & executed the EXPA algorithm for this problem, computed the P array
3. Coded the metabolite connectivity array
